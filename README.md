# An_Expert_System_to_Idetify_the_stages_of_Ovarian_Cancer
# Problem Statement:
Ovarian cancer is the deadliest of gynecologic cancers. Mortality rates are slightly higher 
for African American women than for Caucasian women. The American Cancer Society 
estimates that in 2020, about 21,750 new cases of ovarian cancer will be diagnosed and 
13,940 women will die of ovarian cancer in the United States. Mortality rates for ovarian 
cancer have declined only slightly in the forty years since the “War on Cancer” was 
declared. However, other cancers have shown a much greater reduction in mortality, due 
to many factors. The Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) Program 
reports that in 2016 in the United States approximately 229,875 women were alive who 
had been diagnosed with ovarian cancer (including those who had been cured of the 
disease). Ovarian cancer accounts for 2.5 percent of cancers in women. While the 11th 
most common cancer among women, ovarian cancer is the fifth leading cause of cancerrelated death among women.
An expert system build in prolog can identify the stages of ovarian cancer. It will help a 
medical system as well as a patient to identify the type of ovarian cancer and prescribe 
as per symptoms.
# Aim and Objectives:
• To identify the type of Ovarian Cancer.
• Sharing knowledge with mass people.
• Creating awareness about Ovarian Cancer
• Prescribe treatment and medicine according to the type of cancer
